# Minimal API

## Exploring Minimal APIs in C#: A Simple Example

### In the world of C# programming, Minimal APIs have emerged as a powerful and concise way to build lightweight web applications without the complexity of traditional ASP.NET ### frameworks. Let's dive into a simple example to understand the main characteristics of Minimal APIs.

## 1 - Simplicity and Conciseness: 

### One of the defining features of Minimal APIs is their simplicity. We start by importing the necessary namespaces and then define our API endpoints using lambda expressions. 
### This eliminates the need for separate controller classes and reduces the overall boilerplate code.

## 2 - Routing and Endpoint Mapping: 

### In Minimal APIs, routing and endpoint mapping are handled directly within the app.Map method calls. This provides a clear and intuitive way to define the routes and their corresponding actions.

## DI Integration: 
### Minimal APIs seamlessly integrate with Dependency Injection (DI) containers. Services can be easily injected into the endpoint handler methods, enabling better separation of concerns and testability.
